NAME
       CPAN::Testers::WWW::Reports::Query::Reports
       
DESCRIPTION
       This module queries the CPAN Testers website and retrieves a data set.
       For a date request, the data set returned relates to the ids that can
       be retrieved for that date. A range request will return the records for
       the requested IDs.

SYNOPSIS
           # establish the object
           my $query = CPAN::Testers::WWW::Reports::Query::Reports->new;

           # get list of ids for a particular date
           my $result = $query->date(
               '2012-02-08' # must be YYYY-MM-DD format
           );

           # $query is a hash ref
           print "From: $result->{from}, To: $result->{to}, Range: $result->{range}\n";

           # $result->{list} is an array of the actual ids posted for the given date.
           # note that this list may not include all ids within $result->{range}.
           print "List: " . join(', ',@{$result->{list}}) . "\n";


           # get metabase for a range of ids
           my $result = $query->range(
               '20080300-20120330'

               # '20120330'  # just get <id>
               # '20120330-' # from <id> until the latest [see caveat]
               # '-20120330' # previous <n> reports up to <id> [see caveat]
               # '-'         # the latest <n> reports [see caveat]
           );

           # $result is a hash ref, with the reports ids as the top level keys
           my @ids = sort keys %$result;
           my $id  = $ids[0];
           print "id = $id, dist = '$result->{$id}{dist}', version = '$result->{$id}{version}'\n";


           # get the raw data for all results, or a specific version if supplied
           my $data = $query->raw;

	   # get the last error
	   my $error = $query->error;

   Caveat
       When using the range parameter, note that at most 2500 records will be
       returned. This is to avoid accidental request for all the records!

       This value may change in the future.

INTERFACE
   The Constructor
       ·   new

           Instatiates the object CPAN::WWW::Testers. Requires a hash of
           parameters, with 'config' being the only mandatory key. Note that
           'config' can be anything that Config::IniFiles accepts for the
           -file option.

   Search Methods
       ·   date

           For the given date, returns a hash describing the IDs accessible
           for that date.

       ·   range

           For the given range, returns the metadata records stored for those
           IDs.

   Data Methods
       ·   raw

           Returns the raw content returned from the server.

       ·   error

           Returns the last recorded error.
